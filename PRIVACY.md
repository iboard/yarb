* Your password get stored encrypted.
* Your name get stored.
* A mail with your sign up-infomation may get mailed to the
  admin of the server. The Sign-up-information includes the ip-address
  of the client you have used to sign-up.
* If you use an invitation-token to sign-up we send an email to the
  sender of this invitation
* If you use an Authentication-provide we'll store the provider and the
  uid you have at this provider. We'll never access your provider's
  account for other reasons than authentication.
* If you cancel your account all your user information will be destroyed.
  Anyhow, there maybe entries in the server's log-file which remains
  there even when you have deleted your account.

At **iboard.cc** this information will not be visible to anybody expect
server's admins. We will not use this information for anything.
Rarely we'll email you about your YARB-subscription.

YARB is open source and if you read this file for another domain
as _iboard.cc_ we can't control what happens to your data neither can
we force the owner to change this f* massage.
